# A Web Server for Fun

A web server developed in C just for fun! Currently developing in the latest
Linux mainline kernel (5.19.6). I might not have time to port this to Windows
but if you have any idea on time, feel free to contribute to this.

# Development Environment

- Linux (5.19.6)
- GCC (12.2)
- Doxygen (1.9.3)
- CMake (3.24.1)
- AStyle (3.)
